## Servings: 2

## Time to prepare: 15 minutes

## Ingredients:
2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 shallot, minced
¼ pound white or cremini mushrooms, rinsed briefly and wiped dry
Salt
Freshly ground pepper to taste
1 to 2 garlic cloves (to taste), minced
2 teaspoons minced flat-leaf parsley
4 eggs
1 tablespoon minced chives
2 teaspoons low-fat milk
3 tablespoons grated Gruyère cheese


## Equipment needed:
Large frying pan
Spatula


## Steps for preparation:
Step 1
Trim off the ends of the mushrooms, and cut into thick slices. Heat a large, heavy frying pan over medium-high heat, and add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Add the shallot, and cook, stirring, until it begins to soften, two or three minutes. Add the mushrooms, and cook, stirring or tossing in the pan, for a few minutes, until they begin to soften and sweat. Add salt to taste and the garlic, and cook, stirring often, until the mushrooms are tender, about five minutes. Stir in the parsley

Step 2
If making individual omelets: Heat an 8-inch nonstick omelet pan over medium-high heat. Break 2 eggs into a bowl, and beat with a fork or a whisk until frothy. Add salt and freshly ground pepper to taste, and 2 teaspoons milk. Whisk in half the chives. Add 2 teaspoons of the olive oil to the pan. When the pan feels hot as you hold your hand above it, pour in the eggs, scraping every last bit into the pan. Tilt the pan to distribute the eggs evenly over the surface. Tilt it slightly again

Step 3
If making 1 large omelet, heat a 10-inch nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Beat all 4 eggs in a bowl with the milk, salt and pepper, and the chives. Heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in the pan, and follow the instructions for the 2-egg omelet, pouring all of the eggs into the pan. The eggs will take longer to set, and you may want to flip the omelet in the pan again after it’s rolled, if the middle seems too runny. Roll the finished omelet onto a platter, or cut in half in the

Step 4
Add 2 teaspoons of the olive oil to the pan. When the pan feels hot as you hold your hand above it, pour in the eggs, scraping every last bit into the pan. Tilt the pan to distribute the eggs evenly over the surface. Tilt it slightly again, and gently shake with one hand while lifting up the edges of the omelet with the spatula in your other hand so as to let the eggs run underneath during the first few minutes of cooking.

Step 5
Spread half the mushrooms down the middle of the eggs. Top with half the cheese. As soon as the eggs are set on the bottom (the top will still be runny), jerk the pan quickly away from you then back towards you so that the omelet folds over on itself. 

### Notes:
Advance preparation: You can make the mushroom filling (step 1) several hours ahead. It will keep for a day or two in the refrigerator. Reheat before making the omelets. Martha Rose Shulman can be reached at martha-rose-shulman.com.

The earliest omelettes are believed to have originated in ancient Persia.
